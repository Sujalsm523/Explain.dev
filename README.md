## 🌟 About The Project

**explain.dev** is a browser extension designed for developers, students, and anyone who works with code. It addresses the common challenge of encountering an unfamiliar or complex code snippet and needing a quick, clear explanation.

Instead of breaking your workflow to search through documentation, you can simply highlight the code, right-click, and receive a detailed, easy-to-understand explanation generated by a powerful AI model, directly in your browser. With the latest updates, you can now customize the AI's instructions and review your past queries in a built-in history tab.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Context Menu Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with the right-click menu for quick access.
- **AI-Powered Explanations:** Leverages the Google Gemini API to provide high-quality, human-like explanations.
- **Custom Prompts:** Tailor the AI's instructions to fit your needs, whether you want a simple explanation or a deep dive into performance.
- **Explanation History:** Automatically saves your last 50 explanations for easy review, so you never lose a valuable insight.
- **Clean, Tabbed UI:** A simple and intuitive interface built with Tailwind CSS, allowing you to switch between the explainer and your history.
- **Markdown Rendering:** Displays formatted responses, including lists, bold text, and code blocks, for better readability.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The extension operates using a few core components of the Chrome Extension ecosystem:

1.  **Background Script (`background.js`):** This script creates the "Explain this code with AI" option in the right-click context menu when you have text selected.
2.  **Popup Script (`popup.js`):** When you click the context menu item, the selected code is temporarily stored using `chrome.storage`. The popup window is then opened, retrieving the code.
3.  **API Call:** When you click the "Explain Code" button, the script combines your custom prompt with the selected code and sends it to the **Google Gemini API**.
4.  **Data Handling:** The AI's response is rendered from Markdown to HTML. The original code and the explanation are saved as an entry in your local history via `chrome.storage`.
5.  **History Tab:** This tab reads from `chrome.storage` to display a list of your past explanations.

## 🚀 Getting Started
