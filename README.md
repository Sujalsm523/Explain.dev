üåü About The Project
Explain.dev is a browser extension designed for developers, students, and anyone who works with code. It addresses the common challenge of encountering an unfamiliar or complex code snippet and needing a quick, clear explanation.

Instead of breaking your workflow to search through documentation, you can simply highlight the code, right-click, and receive a detailed, easy-to-understand explanation generated by a powerful AI model, directly in your browser. With the latest updates, you can now customize the AI's instructions and review your past queries in a built-in history tab.

‚ú® Key Features
Context Menu Integration: Seamlessly integrates with the right-click menu for quick access.

AI-Powered Explanations: Leverages the Google Gemini API to provide high-quality, human-like explanations.

Custom Prompts: Tailor the AI's instructions to fit your needs, whether you want a simple explanation or a deep dive into performance.

Explanation History: Automatically saves your last 50 explanations for easy review, so you never lose a valuable insight.

Clean, Tabbed UI: A simple and intuitive interface built with Tailwind CSS, allowing you to switch between the explainer and your history.

Markdown Rendering: Displays formatted responses, including lists, bold text, and code blocks, for better readability.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
The extension operates using a few core components of the Chrome Extension ecosystem:

Background Script (background.js): This script creates the "Explain this code with AI" option in the right-click context menu when you have text selected.

Popup Script (popup.js): When you click the context menu item, the selected code is temporarily stored using chrome.storage. The popup window is then opened, retrieving the code.

API Call: When you click the "Explain Code" button, the script combines your custom prompt with the selected code and sends it to the Google Gemini API.

Data Handling: The AI's response is rendered from Markdown to HTML. The original code and the explanation are saved as an entry in your local history via chrome.storage.

History Tab: This tab reads from chrome.storage to display a list of your past explanations.
